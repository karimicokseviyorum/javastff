# Week 3 Java Exercises

This directory contains Java programs demonstrating important programming concepts:

## FloatingComparison.java
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates proper floating-point number comparison
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Integer vs floating-point division differences
  - Why direct equality comparison (`==`) is unreliable for floating-point numbers
  - Using tolerance/epsilon for safe floating-point comparisons
  - Demonstrates how arithmetic operations can affect floating-point precision

## EscapeLoop.java
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates loop control statements (`break` and `continue`)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Using `break` to exit loops completely
  - Using `continue` to skip remaining loop body and start next iteration
  - Examples in both `while` and `for` loops
  - Proper handling of loop counters with `continue`
- **Examples Include**:
  - Breaking while loop at specific value
  - Skipping specific iterations using continue
  - Breaking for loop at condition
  - Using continue to filter even numbers

## Key Takeaways for Week 3:
- Floating-point arithmetic is inherently imprecise due to binary representation
- Always use tolerance-based comparison for floating-point numbers
- Understanding type conversion in arithmetic operations
- Importance of proper variable initialization and comparison methods
- Loop control statements provide flow control within iterations
- `break` and `continue` serve different purposes in loop management
- Careful counter management needed when using `continue`
