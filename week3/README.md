# Week 3 Java Exercises

This directory contains Java programs demonstrating important programming concepts:

## FloatingComparison.java
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates proper floating-point number comparison
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Integer vs floating-point division differences
  - Why direct equality comparison (`==`) is unreliable for floating-point numbers
  - Using tolerance/epsilon for safe floating-point comparisons
  - Demonstrates how arithmetic operations can affect floating-point precision

## Key Takeaways for Week 3:
- Floating-point arithmetic is inherently imprecise due to binary representation
- Always use tolerance-based comparison for floating-point numbers
- Understanding type conversion in arithmetic operations
- Importance of proper variable initialization and comparison methods
